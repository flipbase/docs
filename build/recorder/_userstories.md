# Implementation

We thought it might come in handy to provide you with some predefined (and non-exhausting list of) user stories:

* As a recruiter I need to be able to **enable or disable** per webpage (e.g. vacancy, profile or company) the Flipbase recorder.js, so I do not have the Flipbase recorder enabled by default all webpages. 

* As a recruiter I liked to **show a description or introduction** (that can be edited per webpage) to the end-user above the recorder, so I can explain what we expected of a submitted video.

* As a recruiter I need to have the option to mark video submission as **mandatory or optional** on a webpage basis (e.g. vacancy, profile or company), 

* As an end-user I would like to (re-)view my just submitted video, **when form validation fails** on the server and I need to validate the input, so I don't have to re-record the video.

* As an end-user I liked to use the recorder application the **default language of my browser**, so I don't manually have to choose my preferred language. 

* As an end-user I liked to get notified if the the video was saved and need to finish additional fields before leaving the page or submitting the form, so I am assured the form is submitted as expected by the receiver.
