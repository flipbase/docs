# Create an Organization

Organizations are best used to group multiple Collections. Collections are in essence a repository of videos that share the same configuration. Usually for each customer a different Organization is created.

However, it's not unlikely to create multiple Organizations for a single customer when they want to distinguish videos from (for example) different countries. Additionally, in very rare occasion, it might be handy to create different Organizations for different departments. Other then that, it is usually best, to create a single Organization for a single Customer.

So, how you choose to implement Organizations is up to you.

When creating an Organization you need to provide the following properties:

## name

Just for structural purpose we need to provide a `name`. This cannot property cannot be empty.

## description

Describe what this Organization is about and what kind of Collections and Videos the Organization will contain.
