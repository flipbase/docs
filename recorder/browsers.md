# Browser support

Flipbase is supported in the browsers listed below. We differentiate recording functionality using the webcam (which requires Flash) and video upload functionality (which is used on smartphones and tablets, when Flash is not supported). Video upload functionality uses HTML5 and therefore is not supported on older browsers.
